---

## How to resume in a new session

1. Open `C:\Training\Projects\Evolving-Multi-Agent-Framework` in VS Code or your terminal.
2. Read **`INSTRUCTIONS.md` at the repo root** first (entry point for any agent).
3. It will direct you to read in this order:
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (session-start authority)
   - `spec-driven-development/CONTEXT.md` (shared vocabulary)
   - `spec-driven-development/sessions/SESSION-MEMORY.md` (this file — most recent checkpoint)
   - `spec-driven-development/constitution/roadmap.md` (current PI status)
4. Optional: open `spec-driven-development/docs/CHEAT-SHEET.html` in a browser for the visual workflow.

To continue working on the framework itself, the natural next moves are:
- Run `/replan` against the fleet-ledger pilot to formally close PI-1
- Pick a real project to bootstrap (greenfield with `archetype-recommender` + `bootstrap.py greenfield`, or brownfield with `bootstrap.py brownfield --draft-only`)
- Curate the 4 lessons in `spec-driven-development/sprints/PI-1/lessons.md` via `/evolve`
- Exercise `/hire` to create a real new role (e.g., `data-analyst` generic)

---

## Project purpose, in one sentence

A portable, replicable system for orchestrating a fleet of AI agents through a structured, spec-driven, test-driven development lifecycle. One human + a team of specialized AI agents shipping production-quality features with traceability and minimal ceremony overhead.

## What we built today

### Starting state (commit `d6332c0`, before today)
- Framework scaffolded but unproven (v0.1)
- Constitution/CONTEXT/roadmap referenced the Day-to-Day Agent host project
- No pilot ever run; no validation that the lifecycle works in practice
- Domain skills under `.github/skills/domain/` were Day-to-Day-specific
- No bootstrap mechanism — adopters had to manually copy files
- "Evolving" was aspirational, not mechanical

### Ending state (commit `23156a0`, end of session)
- **29 commits** on origin/master
- **28 framework skills** across 5 categories (core, workflow, engineering, operational, domain)
- **17 slash commands** (added /ask, /constitution, /evolve, /replan, /hire today)
- **10 binding constitution articles** (I–X, all with semver frontmatter)
- **7 ADRs** (added 4 today: 004, 005, 006, 007)
- **5 starter archetypes** (python-library, python-web-service, data-pipeline, cli-tool, research-repo)
- **Working CLI** (`bootstrap.py greenfield <archetype>` and `bootstrap.py brownfield <target>`)
- **Working fleet ledger** at `spec-driven-development/ledger/fleet.db` with init script + query CLI + 13 passing tests
- **First feature shipped end-to-end** via the framework's own lifecycle (`specs/2026-05-12-fleet-ledger/`)
- **PI-1 lessons.md** seeded with 4 honest candidates from the pilot
- **Cheat sheet HTML** with visual SVG workflow diagram for greenfield + brownfield + lifecycle
- **Guided UX** — Executive Manager loads `archetype-recommender` skill on new-project intent, walks human through 5-6 questions with reasoning + confidence, falls back to `/evolve` if none of the 5 archetypes fit

## Architecture (the mental model that drove all decisions)

```
Human (you)
   │
   ▼
Executive Manager  ← single human entry point. Knows the big picture.
   │
   ├─► Principal Architect       ─┐
   ├─► Principal Product Manager  ─┼─► STRATEGY layer (decide WHAT and HOW)
   ├─► Principal Software Dev     ─┘
   │                                Each Principal dispatches workers as needed:
   │
   ▼
Worker Agents (the actual hands)  ← TACTICS layer (DO the work)
   ├─ Developer        ─ generic
   ├─ UX Designer      ─ generic
   ├─ QA Engineer      ─ generic
   ├─ Data Scientist   ─ generic
   ├─ Data Analyst     ─ created on demand via /hire generic
   ├─ AI Engineer      ─ created on demand via /hire generic
   ├─ Azure Data Eng.  ─ created on demand via /hire generic
   └─ <role>-<name>-<domain>-<n>  ─ specialists earned via /hire specialist
```

**Vendor analogy:** The human is the client. The Executive Manager is the engagement manager — your single phone number. Principals are partner-level consultants who decide strategy. Workers are the actual hands doing the work, dispatched per task, constrained to 1–3 files. Specialization is *earned* through demonstrated competence, never assigned by configuration.

---

## The 10 binding articles (current constitution, principles.md)

1. **I.** Two-folder split is invariant (`.github/` + `spec-driven-development/`)
2. **II.** Single human entry point: the Executive Manager (ADR-0004)
3. **III.** Two-stage review order is fixed: spec compliance, then code quality
4. **IV.** Specialization over generalism: workers 1–3 files; reviewers review only
5. **V.** Generic by default, specialized on demand (ADR-0003)
6. **VI.** Ceremony proportional to risk (the spec sizing rule)
7. **VII.** Every artifact is a file; every dispatch is logged
8. **VIII.** Constitution is immutable without an ADR
9. **IX.** Human holds final approval on Level-2 decisions
10. **X.** Validation is a pre-implementation contract (Article X, ADR-0005)

All 6 constitution files now carry YAML frontmatter: `version: '1.0.0'`, `ratified: 2026-05-12`, `last_amended: 2026-05-12`. Amendments must use `/constitution` which semver-bumps and runs the propagation scan via `constitution-sync` skill (ADR-0006).

---

## All 17 slash commands (full list)

### Entry & status
- `/ask` — ask Executive Manager anything; it routes + synthesizes
- `/state` — refresh + present `exec/state.md`
- `/grill` — free-form grilling to sharpen an idea before `/clarify`

### Lifecycle
- `/triage` — RICE-score idea, assign P1–P4
- `/clarify` — one question at a time, with recommendation
- `/spec` — generate feature spec + validation contract (Article X)
- `/plan` — implementation plan from approved spec
- `/tasks` — decompose plan into tagged 1–3-file tasks
- `/analyze` — read-only consistency check (spec vs plan vs tasks)
- `/implement` — execute one task (TDD, Article X gate)
- `/fleet` — parallel dispatch of [P][AFK] tasks
- `/qa` — validate implementation against spec (two-stage)

### Ceremony & evolution
- `/retro` — sprint retro, max 3 action items
- `/replan` — after every DONE: review constitution/roadmap/skills/lessons
- `/evolve` — curate lessons backlog into framework changes (SHIP/DEFER/DISCARD)
- `/constitution` — amend constitution with semver + propagation scan
- `/hire` — create new worker role: generic OR promote generic to specialist (ADR-0007, Level-2 draft-first)

---

## Key design decisions (from this session, with ADR references)

### ADR-0004: Executive Manager as orchestrator and single entry point
Re-scoped from passive reporter (read-only state.md) to active orchestrator. Owns kickoff capture, ad-hoc Q&A routing with answer synthesis, status, escalation, big-picture awareness. Reads state.md by default, may read raw artifacts to answer routed questions, never modifies anything except (optionally) state.md. Rejected adding a fifth Principal as too complex.

### ADR-0005: Validation as pre-implementation contract (Article X)
The strongest convergent finding from research across all 3 code-based inspirations (Spec-Kit, DeepLearning.AI SDD course, sc-spec companion). Validation criteria are written DURING /spec, locked at /tasks, and verified at /qa. Implementation is not done until every checkbox is checked or `[NO-TEST-NEEDED]` is documented. Killed the "AI wrote something that looks right but doesn't match the spec" failure mode.

### ADR-0006: Constitution semantic versioning
Every constitution file gets YAML frontmatter (version, ratified, last_amended). Amendments use `/constitution` which semver-bumps (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH), runs the propagation scan via `constitution-sync` skill, and emits a Sync Impact Report listing what skills/prompts/templates need review. Closes the "constitution drift" silent risk.

### ADR-0007: /hire command and role lifecycle
ADR-0003 documented the model in prose ("generic by default, specialized on demand"). ADR-0007 makes it executable. Two modes: `/hire <role-name> generic` creates a new role on the fly (data-analyst, ai-engineer, azure-data-engineer); `/hire <role>-<name>-<domain>-<n> specialist` promotes a generic worker to permanent specialist with own skill pack, requires citing prior dispatch evidence. Both modes are Level-2 draft-first: produce draft + report, human approves, only then files land. Executive Manager awareness via BOTH `exec/state.md` Fleet line AND ledger `decisions` row (per user choice option C).

---

## The pilot proof (commit `9ace815`)

The framework's own first feature shipped through its own lifecycle as the dogfood. Feature: fleet ledger v0.1.

**Lifecycle artifacts at `spec-driven-development/specs/2026-05-12-fleet-ledger/`:**
- `spec.md` — full spec with testable acceptance criteria
- `plan.md` — 3-phase plan
- `tasks.md` — 8 tagged tasks, test-first ordering
- `validation.md` — pre-implementation contract (Article X format), all checkboxes verified
- `clarification-log.md` — 5 self-clarification Q&A entries
- `RETRO.md` — what worked, what didn't, lessons fed to PI-1 lessons.md

**Implementation at `spec-driven-development/ledger/`:**
- `schema.sql` — dispatches + decisions tables
- `init_ledger.py` — stdlib-only idempotent ledger init
- `ledger_cli.py` — record-dispatch, record-decision, mark-outcome, list-pi, list-feature, summary
- `test_ledger.py` — **13 tests, all passing in 0.81s**
- `fleet.db` — initialized empty SQLite DB, committed

**Lessons captured in `spec-driven-development/sprints/PI-1/lessons.md`:**
- LESSON-001: canonical Python CLI style guide (3 stdlib CLIs in tree should share style)
- LESSON-002: clarify task ID convention
- LESSON-003: reduce validation duplication across artifacts
- LESSON-004: define ledger migration policy

These 4 lessons are ready for `/evolve` curation in a future session.

## Inspiration audit findings (from research subagents)

We dispatched 4 parallel research subagents to actually inspect the 4 cited inspiration sources. Findings:

### Two factual corrections shipped in commit `6825943`
1. **Spec-Kit is by GitHub, not Cline.** Repo: https://github.com/github/spec-kit
2. **`sc-spec-driven-development-files` is the companion code repo for the DeepLearning.AI SDD course** taught by **Paul Everitt of JetBrains**. Not a separate inspiration — same source as the course. So we have 3 distinct inspirations + SAFe, not 4.
3. **Matt Pocock credit nuance:** his canonical `grill-me` is ~60 words; ours is ~600 words plus a separate prompt file. Credit the core concept to Pocock; elaboration is our own.

### Convergent finding (drove ADR-0005 / Article X)
All 3 code-based inspirations independently say validation/test criteria belong BEFORE implementation, not after.

### Borrowed and shipped this session
- `argument-hint` frontmatter field on all skills + prompts (Pocock, commit `43115fd`)
- `handoff` skill (Pocock, commit `c4e9956`)
- `/replan` ceremony (DLAI course, commit `c4e9956`)
- Date-prefix feature dirs `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-name/` (Spec-Kit + sc-spec, commit `c4e9956`)
- Constitution semver + propagation check (Spec-Kit `/speckit.constitution`, commits `d36594e` + ADR-0006)
- Pre-implementation validation contract (all 3 sources, commit `2b1d272` + ADR-0005)

### Deliberately NOT borrowed (anti-patterns for our model)
1. Spec-Kit's single-agent model (would erase our PM→Architect→SW Dev→Worker chain)
2. Python wheel CLI as primary distribution (breaks our portable Markdown model)
3. `.specify/extensions.yml` before/after hook system (too much coordination overhead)
4. Folding research into `/plan` (conflates PM and Architect roles)

## What's NOT done (intentionally deferred)

These are honest gaps. Future PIs.

1. **No second-project portability test.** Framework claims to work on any project. Dogfood proved it works on its OWN project. PI-3 milestone: bootstrap onto a totally different stack to validate.
2. **No GitHub Issues integration.** Spec-Kit has `/taskstoissues`. Deferred.
3. **CLI scripts are stdlib-only and minimal.** Work but not pretty. Polish is PI-2 work.
4. **`fleet.db` schema is v0.1.** Just dispatches and decisions. Migration policy is LESSON-004 for /evolve.
5. **No web UI / dashboard.** Everything is files + Copilot Chat. Future feature.
6. **Brownfield archaeology is shallow heuristic.** Complex codebases still need human grilling for hidden conventions, undocumented agreements, deploy quirks.
7. **`/replan` and `/evolve` exist but never been run for real.** Framework's own retro on the dogfood is captured in PI-1 lessons.md but not yet curated.
8. **No `/hire` ever actually invoked.** Mechanism exists, never exercised.
9. **CLI scaffolds (fleet.py, qa.py, retro.py, state_builder.py) still empty.** Their functionality is provided through the agent/skill/prompt layer today; CLI implementations would be future polish.

---

## Strong recommendations for next session

In priority order:

### Highest value: actually use the framework on a real project
- Pick a small new internal tool (1-week scope) OR a focused refactor in an existing project
- Run `bootstrap.py greenfield` (with archetype-recommender) OR `bootstrap.py brownfield --draft-only`
- Walk one feature end-to-end through the lifecycle
- Run `/replan` after DONE
- File real frustrations as lessons via `lesson-capture` skill
- This is the second dogfood — proves portability

### Medium value: close the open loops on the dogfood
- Run `/replan` against the fleet-ledger pilot
- Curate the 4 LESSON-* candidates in `spec-driven-development/sprints/PI-1/lessons.md` via `/evolve`
- Mark PI-1 as DONE in roadmap.md, define PI-2 scope
- This validates the evolution loop end-to-end (project → framework feedback)

### Lower value: tactical polish
- Implement the CLI scaffolds (fleet.py, qa.py, retro.py, state_builder.py)
- Write more domain skills as projects demand them
- Consider GitHub Issues bridge (`/taskstoissues` from Spec-Kit)

## Quick command reference for resuming

```powershell
# Verify state
cd C:\Training\Projects\Evolving-Multi-Agent-Framework
git pull
git log --oneline -5

# View the cheat sheet
start spec-driven-development\docs\CHEAT-SHEET.html

# Run the dogfood tests to confirm the pilot still works
python -m pytest spec-driven-development\ledger\test_ledger.py -v

# Try the bootstrap CLI
python spec-driven-development\cli\bootstrap.py --help
python spec-driven-development\cli\bootstrap.py greenfield --help
python spec-driven-development\cli\bootstrap.py brownfield --help

# Inspect what archetypes are available
ls spec-driven-development\archetypes\
```

---

## Open design questions (from foundations strategy memo §7, still unresolved)

1. **Framework versioning model** — semver on the framework as a whole? Pin per-host?
2. **Distribution model** — GitHub template repo? scaffolding CLI? npm/pip package?
3. **Host-vs-framework skill ownership** — when a host modifies a framework skill, does it diverge or fork? Need a clear rule.
4. **Hard pilot date** — to avoid perpetual "almost ready to pilot." (Mitigated today with the actual dogfood, but still relevant for the second-project test.)

These should be decided before PI-3 (portability validation).

---

## Files in this session workspace worth preserving

- `framework-foundations-strategy.md` — strategic memo from earlier in the session about evolution loops, greenfield/brownfield convergence, SDD+TDD integration, adoption barriers
- `inspiration-repos-research-findings.md` — full synthesis of the 4 research subagent reports
- `SESSION-MEMORY.md` — this file

---

## Update: 2026-05-16 PM — state-dashboard v0.2 + SDD-002 closed

User UX review surfaced 10 issues and one hard requirement: **the dashboard must be live, not a static file**. Both addressed in v0.2 of the same feature, in the same session.

**Two specs reconciled, one impl shipped:**
- `2026-05-16-state-builder/` (SDD-002) — canonical spec for `state.md` 7-section format with `--sdd-root` / `--pi` / `--dry-run` CLI. Author: Principal Software Developer. Closed DONE.
- `2026-05-16-state-dashboard/` — additive spec for live HTML + Bridge UX. Author: Executive Manager response to user pain. Closed DONE v0.2.
- Both contracts satisfied by single file `cli/state_builder.py`. Cross-referenced in the docstring.

**Live server:** `python spec-driven-development/cli/state_builder.py serve [--port 8765] [--no-open]` starts a stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer`. Rebuilds state on every GET. `/healthz` for monitoring. Page auto-refreshes every 20s. Browser auto-opens.

**v0.2 UX fixes shipped:**
- Multi-segment PI progress bar (feature distribution across all 9 stages + color legend)
- All kanban cards have stage-colored left borders (faint → amber → oxblood → jade)
- Card text contrast bumped to AAA (`--ink-paper-dim` for meta)
- Column count badges
- Empty kanban columns get dashed border + dimmed header
- Recommended-action CTA link to feature dir or roadmap
- Recent commits get color-coded type tags (feat/docs/chore/design/plan/fix) + relative dates
- Header `[refresh]` button
- Dispatch empty state is a bordered card with hint

**Test count now: 13 passing** (9 SDD-002 ACs + 3 state-dashboard visual + 1 live-server smoke + 13 ledger = 26 total). SDD-002 AC1-AC10 fully covered (AC9 manual `--help` check).

**Lesson candidate (LESSON-008):** When two parallel specs target the same implementation file, declare one as canonical for the file's primary contract and treat the other as additive scope.

**Next action per the dashboard itself:** start `cli/fleet.py` — next PI-2 commitment, Sprint A. The dashboard now correctly recommends it because both state-builder and state-dashboard are DONE.

## Update: 2026-05-16 evening — fleet.py shipped + cloud-security architect hired (draft)

**Two parallel tracks executed in one session:**

### Track 1: cli/fleet.py (SDD-003) DONE

End-to-end SDD lifecycle in one session, same pattern as state-dashboard:
- Spec, clarification log, validation contract, tasks, RETRO all at `specs/2026-05-16-fleet/`
- Implementation: `cli/fleet.py` (~13 KB, stdlib + local ledger_cli only)
- Tests: `cli/test_fleet.py` (10 acceptance tests, all passing)
- Subcommands: `dispatch`, `mark-outcome`, `status`, `list`
- Dispatch packets written to `dispatches/<pi>/<dispatch-id>.md` using `templates/agent-brief.md` as the template
- **First real dispatch shipped through the system:** dispatch #1 recorded, packet emitted at `dispatches/PI-2/000001.md`, marked success — now visible in state-dashboard's "Recently Completed" section
- Roadmap F1 (cli/fleet.py) marked DONE

### Track 2: principal-cloud-security-architect hired (draft) + SDD-007 design

User asked for a cloud-security expert. Drafted (Level-2 pending approval per ADR-0007):
- `.github/agents/principal-cloud-security-architect.agent.md` — new 5th Principal, narrow domain scope (not orchestrator)
- `.github/skills/operational/azure-deployment-architecture/SKILL.md` — encodes default Azure pattern (ACA + Entra ID + scale-to-zero) with threat-model template and cost ceiling
- `roster/agents.json` entry with `status: draft`
- `roster/skills.json` entry for the new skill
- `docs/ADR/008-hire-cloud-security-architect.md` — Level-2 decision record, awaiting human approval

**Cloud dashboard design (SDD-007, P3):**
- `specs/2026-05-16-cloud-dashboard/DESIGN.md` (15 KB) — full architecture exploration
- Recommended: Azure Container Apps + Microsoft Entra ID + scale-to-zero, ~$0/mo under MSDN credit
- Concrete Dockerfile (pinned 3.13-slim, non-root, stdlib only)
- Concrete GitHub Actions workflow with OIDC federation (no stored service principal secret)
- Full step-by-step az CLI runbook (RG → LAW → ACA Env → ACA App → Entra auth → federated credential → cost alert → first deploy → teardown)
- Threat model with 7 categories + residual risks
- Added to BACKLOG.md as SDD-007 P3 "Design exploration complete"

**Test count now: 44 passing** (13 ledger + 13 state_builder + 10 fleet + others). +18 tests this round.

**LESSON-009 captured:** Windows tests using sqlite3 + TemporaryDirectory need `ignore_cleanup_errors=True` + `gc.collect()` in tearDown.

**State-dashboard now shows live data:** dispatch #1 visible, next-action heuristic correctly points at the next undone PI-2 commitment.

**Awaiting Level-2 human approval:**
- ADR-0008 (hire principal-cloud-security-architect)
- SDD-007 scope confirmation
- Cost ceiling for cloud deployment ($10/mo recommended, $5/mo alert)
- Decision on OIDC vs service principal secret

## Update: 2026-05-16 late evening -- LIVE CLOUD DEPLOYMENT

User authorized end-to-end execution: "yes you can log in for me, so finish end to end". Cloud-Security Architect promoted draft -> active by delivering a working secure deployment same day.

**THE DASHBOARD IS LIVE AT:**

    https://state-dashboard.politehill-ac7984d9.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io/

(Requires Microsoft Entra ID sign-in as rodolfolermacontreras@gmail.com -- single allowed user.)

**Azure resources provisioned in rg-bridge-dashboard (West US 2):**
- Container Apps Environment: cae-bridge-dashboard
- Container App: state-dashboard (min=0, max=2, 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GiB, scale-to-zero)
- Auto-created Azure Container Registry (ca24921a026cacr.azurecr.io, Basic)
- Auto-created Log Analytics workspace
- Entra app registration "Bridge Dashboard Auth" (client id 625bdb84-d2e6-4853-96a9-f601571e3a0f)
- Enterprise app with appRoleAssignmentRequired=true, user assigned

**Security posture verified:**
- HTTPS enforced
- Unauthenticated GET / returns 302 -> login.microsoftonline.com
- /healthz also auth-gated (no information disclosure)
- Single user allow-list via assignment-required + only Rodolfo assigned
- Non-root container (UID 10001), no secrets baked in image, scale-to-zero saves cost

**Cost: $0/month expected** under MSDN credit (free tier covers single-user usage).

**Deployed via** `az containerapp up --source .` which used ACR Build (no local Docker required). For repeat deploys see `specs/2026-05-16-cloud-dashboard/PROVISIONED.md` operational commands or set up the GitHub Actions OIDC workflow from DESIGN.md §6.

**Deferred to v1.1:**
- Cost budget alert (set up in Portal in 30 seconds; CLI shorthand parser issue documented)
- GitHub Actions push-to-deploy (workflow YAML ready in DESIGN.md §6)
- Custom domain
- Image digest pinning

**ADR-0008** updated: Cloud-Security Architect promoted draft -> active. SDD-007 marked DEPLOYED in BACKLOG.

**Roadmap state:** PI-1 closed, PI-2 ongoing (state_builder + fleet shipped, qa.py + retro.py + schema lint remain). PI-2 informally now also includes the unscheduled SDD-007 which shipped as a bonus.
