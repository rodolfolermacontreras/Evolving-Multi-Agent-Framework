# Sprint Progress Ledger

Append-only. Each completed feature appends a result block (format defined in
[../feature-prompts/_SHARED_ONBOARDING.md](../feature-prompts/_SHARED_ONBOARDING.md)
section 8).

The latest test baseline lives in the most recent block. **Read from the bottom
up to find current state.**

Maintained by feature workers themselves. The Executive Manager and the
`state_builder.py` CLI consume this file; they do not edit prior entries.
